      <description>Providing everyone equal access to welfare services through NAV is not only legally mandated, but it is fundamental to NAV&amp;rsquo;s mission. A big part of that is making sure our web services are accessible and easy to use. With 80 cross-functional product teams, this work needs to scale well.
In this talk I will explain how we work with accessibility at NAV through our design system and accessibility teams. We will talk about testing, training, sharing and culture building.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered for myself the craft of crocheting. It is a lovely pastime that is very tactile.
There are a lot of programming languages and tools that have an animal as mascot. Think of Python, Go, Rust but also Docker, Postgres and atuin. How cool would it be to be able to crochet the mascot of your favorite programming language or tool!
The workshop would allow participants to come in and receive some crocheting tutoring that enables them to crochet a project of their own choosing.</description>

      <description>Software packaging and distribution is a very simple value proposition, and a surprisingly rich and complex problem underneath. There is a myriad of systems available, and in this workshop will have a closer look at a few common ones. We will go through the stages of building and packaging, and move from a hand-packaged tarball, through dpkg/apt, to the deeply programmable packaging systems guix and nix. All work and no play makes a dull shop, so it is recommended to bring a computer with some tools installed (see list at the end).</description>

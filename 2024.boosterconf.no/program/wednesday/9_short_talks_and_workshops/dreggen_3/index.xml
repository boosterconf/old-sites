      <description>We know that research is important for designing and building good experiences, but how do we make sure we learn and use the most valuable information? When planned strategically, research helps teams make UX fixes and plan product roadmaps that prioritize the biggest audience needs without burning out the people building the software. In this workshop, we will talk about how to align on research purpose, identify and prioritize research questions, thoughtfully execute research, and act on the results in impactful ways.</description>

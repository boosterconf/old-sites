      <description>In this talk I would like to present my thoughts on how small improvements in communication can improve collaboration between team members. Listening skills, asking the right questions, presenting ideas effectively and building on each otherâ€™s ideas can help a team work together more effectively, especially in hybrid workplace settings.</description>

      <description>Retrospectives are often associated with work, but what if you could bring this powerful tool home to improve your family life? I will share my experience of running family retrospectives and a post-mortem after an unsuccessful attempt to buy a new home. These practices have helped us stay sane and connected, be more open, and continuously improve in a blameless manner. I will give tips and tricks on making retros practical and engaging for all ages (4+).</description>

      <description>Throughout the years, once in a while, I&amp;rsquo;d hear people refer to an exercise called &amp;ldquo;Elephant Carpaccio&amp;rdquo;. And yet I never ran into someone actually facilitating the exercise, allowing me to participate. So I ended up doing the next best thing: I ran it a few times myself, with some of my colleagues as benevolent participants / test subjects. Also, it was fully remote.
In this lightning talk I&amp;rsquo;ll share why I like &amp;ldquo;Elephant Carpaccio&amp;rdquo; so much and how I went about facilitating the exercise without ever having done it myself.</description>

      <description>The aim of this lightning talk is to make the listener more self aware on how they can become a better team member, a better colleague and a better person.
The talk is based on a model by Ofman (2000) where he describes the core quadrant that will provide insight into a person&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. The model consists of four parts. Firstly, your CORE QUALITY which is part of your strength as a person.</description>

      <description>The ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity presents new challenges and opportunities as organizations transition from traditional on-premises infrastructures to cloud-based environments. This report describes a real-life chain attack discovered by the offensive team at Storebrand that, if once exploited, would have yielded sensitive financial information about customers. We will examine the key stages of the kill chain, from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration, and highlight the unique considerations when defending both on-premises and cloud-based assets.</description>

      <description>Booster is a non-profit conference, run by a group of volunteers. Our goal is to create the best possible conference for our participants and speakers, and to strengthen the local software development community. Any profits from the conference are used to ensure that we can continue organizing the conference in the following years. We are normally not able to cover travel and lodging for speakers.
There are quite a few exceptions though.</description>

      <title>Booster Code of Conduct</title>

      <description>All attendees, speakers, partners, staff and volunteers at our conference are required to follow the code of conduct.
Short Version Have a good time and help others have a good time too. Say hi to someone you don’t know. Meet interesting people. Don’t act surprised when a person doesn’t conform to a stereotype. No one is at Booster just to represent a minority so start conversations about tech, the weather, the food, the best speaker or the delights of Bergen before talking about “being minority X in tech”.</description>

      <description>Booster is a software conference for the entire team. That means if you’re a developer, project manager, architect, UX professional, tester or security professional, we have something for you!
Our goal is that you come back from the conference with real knowledge you can use. That’s why interactive, hands-on workshops fill up most of the hours of the conference. We also have lightning talks, a few short talks, a couple of keynotes and open spaces.</description>

      <description>Accessibility is often an afterthought, something done manual and late in the development cycle. But I made accessibility break my build and now I will help you break yours! Time to shift accessibility left, add automatic testing that can run in all development steps, catch errors and make the feedback loop as short as possible.
This is not your average dry accessibility talk with long WCAG check lists, but will use lots of humor to try to get the audience to follow along and get the value out of using accessibility tooling.</description>

I am from beautiful Ukraine, where I studied and started my career path: developer, QA and team lead. Since that I have been working in few companies in Norway, both with international and local teams. I like to say that each developer is different, I like to learn their preferable way of working and find the best way of collaborating.</description>

A set of cards to prompt designers in generating ideas to create social, user and business value with machine learning. Participants will experience different ways of visualising and validating their concepts. We will also introduce two key methods (confusion matrix and uncertainty analysis) for validating new potential AI &amp;amp; ML concepts and opportunities.</description>

      <description>Har du noen gang tatt i bruk en skikkelig bra tjeneste, men så klarer du ikke helt sette fingeren på hva det er som gjør den bra? Eller brukt en utrolig dårlig tjeneste, hvor ting åpenbart ikke er gjort helt «etter boka»?
Vi bruker alle normer og konvensjoner for å utforme digitale løsninger, både bevisst og ubevisst. Ikke alle vet at det finnes en samling av disse, bedre kjent som UX Laws eller UX lover, som mannen Jon Yablonski har samlet i boka «Laws of UX».</description>

We were choosing the next step for our automated UI tests. Another tester thought that the two of us, as the “highest ranking” testers, should make the decision that could affect 10+ teams. I thought we should talk to the teams.</description>

      <description>This workshop will consist of a theory part before the practical bit/workshop.
Prerequisites
Participant knowledge:
Basic knowledge of SQL and Entity Framework is useful. A notion of what DDD is.
When it comes to setting running the code / template, this is what you need:
a GitHub account, or else using the template above will prove difficult 💥 .NET SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) - this is the crux of our exercise. Make sure you at least have this installed.</description>

      <description>Til tross for tekniske utfordringer og misfornøyde Bergensere, har jeg utviklet et spill inspirert av Worldle, hvor spillere gjetter seg frem til bergenske områder. Spillet gir hints om geografisk retning, men utfordringene har inkludert å definere bergenske strøkgrenser og finne en effektiv måte å lagre og visualisere dem på. Presentasjonen handler litt om hvordan man visualiserer geografisk data og mye om hvordan bergenserne har hindret prosessen. Lenken: https://bergle.privatevoid.eu/</description>

      <description>There is a mismatch between our ideals for digital product development and the reality of it. We speak of bridging the gap between business and IT, taking a seat at the table, direct customer involvement, self-organizing teams owning business outcomes. But the reality is this: Software development teams are like silkworms, living inside a protective terrarium, sheltered from the chaotic, toxic environment of the rest of the business. Autonomy is confined to the walls of the terrarium.</description>

      <description>Har du kjent trykket fra et dysfunksjonelt team, der kreativiteten og produktiviteten er som fanget i kvikksand?
Ingen av oss klarer alt alene. Sammen er vi garantert sterkere&amp;hellip; eller? Hva hvis «sammen» blir en belastning i stede for en styrke?
På fjordårets konferanse introduserte en tidligere kollega og jeg de grunnleggende prinsippene for dyrking av fantastiske team. Hva har skjedd siden da? Ganske mye. Vi har tatt prinsippene, dykket dypere, og utviklet et rammeverk - et verktøy som hjelper enhver å etablere eller transformere et team for å nå sitt fulle potensiale.</description>

      <description>One of the great promises of WebAssembly is that you can code in whatever language you want and run it anywhere, including in the browser. Until recently, this hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been the case since you still had to rely on the libraries of your chosen language, which may or may not be non-existent. After all, is your language really turing complete if it does not have a robust 3rd party library for datetime handling?</description>

      <description>Many experienced developers are longing for an opportunity to build an application from scratch. Compared to the heavy legacy applications that you might be dealing with on a daily basis, which are seen as filled with technical debt and incomprehensible architecture and design choices, a fresh start promises that you can finally write code and build an application in &amp;ldquo;the right way.&amp;rdquo;
This was exactly the opportunity my colleague and I recently got and with high motivation we applied many of the principles that we highly value, such as Test-Driven Development and Domain-Driven Design.</description>

      <description>Let’s practice Git together! Why? Because commits are documentation we leave for the next person. We’ll look at workflows for diffing and staging and stashing — along with operations like interactive rebase. You might want to tweak your Git config and practice writing better commit messages. There will be opportunities to resolve merge conflicts, or to get into and out of any other Git messes you discover intentionally or by accident.</description>

      <description>The fastest and easiest way to build a web application is to output HTML directly from the server. But what if you want to add a little interactivity, like letting the user add items to a shopping cart or filter a list of products? If you update the entire page every time the users click something, they&amp;rsquo;ll hate you with a passion. So you might consider using React or Vue, but that involves defining an api and adding a whole other build system to your application.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered for myself the craft of crocheting. It is a lovely pastime that is very tactile.
There are a lot of programming languages and tools that have an animal as mascot. Think of Python, Go, Rust but also Docker, Postgres and atuin. How cool would it be to be able to crochet the mascot of your favorite programming language or tool!
The workshop would allow participants to come in and receive some crocheting tutoring that enables them to crochet a project of their own choosing.</description>

      <description>De færreste organisasjoner har tid og råd til å lage alt selv. Løsningen er å finne rett hyllevare fra markedet, men resultatet blir fort et brokete sett IT-systemer med dårlig kjemi.
I offentlig sektor er det vanlig å overlate anskaffelser til folka som er best på å forvalte avtaler, mens folka som er best på koding tar seg av integrasjonen i etterkant. Det har vi utfordret i digitaliseringsetaten Origo.

Today she’s having a blast at Amedia Produkt og Teknologi, wrangling Node.js apps that make up the micro-frontend architecture for 100+ local editorial media sites from around Norway.</description>

I work as a developer and consultant for Variant Trondheim and I&amp;rsquo;m a life-long computer nerd. Day-to-day I spend most of my time working frontend with a great group of people (my team), but I love diving into other parts of the stack from time to time, such as our deployment pipelines. Besides technology my biggest passion is teaching. I worked as a part-time private teacher throughout all my years as a student, and I love the challenge of communicating something difficult in an interesting and understandable way, something that will hopefully shine through in my talk!</description>

      <description>Organisasjoner ønsker å bli mer datadrevne, men kan ende opp med å styre data til &amp;ldquo;feil&amp;rdquo; sted. Derfor er det viktig å ha tydelige prinsipper for hvordan man skal tenke rundt bruken av data i arbeidet som gjøres.Til å oppnå det kan vi bruke prinsippet om informasjonsflyt beskrevet av Cherns i 1987. Cherns deler bruken av data i tre: for kontroll, for registrering og for aksjon. Han understreker at informasjonen skal flyte dit de trengs for å gjennomføre aksjoner (information for action) - agere - på den.</description>

      <description>Mange sitt fyrste (og siste) møte med Vim er etter ein git merge i terminalen. Og då er vel klisjéen at det einste ein treng å vite er korleis ein kjem seg ut derifrå. Men, Vim kan brukast til utruleg mykje meir enn det, og er eit kraftig tekstredigeringsverktøy som i tillegg til å vera effektivt også er ergonomisk.
Gjennom workshopen vil du lære å navigere, redigere og automatisere ved hjelp av vim-kommandoar og macros.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a small hop out of our timeline, and into one where we&amp;rsquo;re aspiring Common Lisp developers.
Common Lisp is a programming language which was originally developed throughout the eighties, and saw its latest ANSI specification in 1994. And while the specification hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed since, there exists a small but thriving ecosystem of developers, who love building with this language.
In this workshop we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle some real-world exercised using this strange alien technology.</description>

      <description>How often do you take the time to read about all the cool new stuff that&amp;rsquo;s been added to CSS in the last few years? I did exactly that, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to, and I want to share the awesome features I found with you!
Did you know that changing the styling of an element based on the width of its parent is actually really easy? And how about custom colors for native input elements or a powerful way to organize selector specificity?</description>

      <description>Tror du at alle dine valg og beslutninger er basert på rasjonelle tanker? At du alltid forstår hvorfor du handler som du gjør? Sannheten er at hjernen ofte tar snarveier. Dette gjelder også innenfor utvikling.
I en verden hvor beslutningene våre kan ha stor innvirkning på prosjekter og resultater, er det viktig å innse at man noen ganger handler basert på feil informasjon eller antakelser.
Jeg vil gå gjennom noen feilslutninger som jeg og andre utviklere har gjort og forsøke å forklare hvorfor det skjer.</description>

      <description>Figmavariabler gir designere nye superkrefter når de skal lage designsystemer for både små og store organisasjoner. Variabler gjør ikke bare det å lage nye design, som kan tilpasses ulike stiler veldig veldig mye raskere, enkelt og smooth, men den ekte sannheten mellom design og kode kan også bli litt lettere å lage, vedlikeholde og forstå.
Workshopen starter med en gjennomgang av hva Variabler er og litt historien bak design tokens og hva det kan gjøre for team.</description>

      <description>We know that research is important for designing and building good experiences, but how do we make sure we learn and use the most valuable information? When planned strategically, research helps teams make UX fixes and plan product roadmaps that prioritize the biggest audience needs without burning out the people building the software. In this workshop, we will talk about how to align on research purpose, identify and prioritize research questions, thoughtfully execute research, and act on the results in impactful ways.</description>

      <description>Hva skjer egentlig på innsiden av VAR-rommet? I år ble video-assistert dømming (VAR) innført i Eliteserien. Under generalprøvene to måneder før seriestart oppdaget Norges Fotballforbund at de trengte en løsning for å kommunisere mellom VAR-dommerne og medieproduksjonen.
Vi går gjennom prosjektet fra avspark 3. februar til seriestart i Eliteserien 10. april når systemet måtte være live. Akkurat som dommerne selv måtte vi ta viktige avgjørelser under press, og med begrenset tid til å revurdere valgene.</description>

      <description>Ledsagerbevisordningen er et kommunalt tilbud som lar de med behov ta med seg følge på kultur- og fritidsarrangementer. I dag har alle kommunene som tilbyr Ledsagerbevis egne—og tidvis tungvinte—manuelle prosesser. Dette innebærer lamineringsmaskiner, separate søknadsskjemaer og et postvesen som bringer plastkort til innbyggernes postkasser.
KS Digitale Fellestjenester har som mål å lage enhetlige, digitale løsninger for alle norges kommuner. Det var dermed naturlig at KS DIF fikk oppdraget med å utvikle den nye løsningen, i stedet for å la hver kommune lage sin egen versjon.</description>

      <description>Life doesn’t always pan out as we plan for. Sometimes when you lean too far into the rabbit hole you suddenly find yourself on a new career path. Let me take you on a journey through how I went from having programming as part of my core identity, to spending most of my time worrying about people, roadmaps and products visions. This is a real life story about how it’s OK to leave something behind, when something more exiting comes along - and all the frustrations, doubts and joys that comes with it.</description>

      <description>In the winter of 2022 I went on maternity leave. Little did I know what awaited me six months later when I tried to get back into the swing of things.
I had once been a go-to person in my team, confidently making architectural decisions. Now, I found myself repeatedly asking the same questions about Spring Boot.
This is my story of how it felt like going back to work, with a brain that was suddenly failing me, and the way back towards normal.</description>

Most developers I talk with about GDPR, seems to in best case look at it as something that will slow them down and create months long processes with someone in legal who seems to be talking a different language.
GDPR has been in place for 5 years, and yet it seems to be a mystery for most developers.</description>

A big part of that is making sure our web services are accessible and easy to use. With 80 cross-functional product teams, this work needs to scale well.
In this talk I will explain how we work with accessibility at NAV through our design system and accessibility teams. We will talk about testing, training, sharing and culture building.</description>

      <description>Hva er den beste tilnærmingen til det å flytte store deler av bankens tjenester og infrastruktur fra et onsite datasenter og ut i den store skyen? Hvordan kan vi ta ned risikoen til et minimum, samtidig som vi gjør opplevelsen så smidig som mulig, både for utviklere og sluttbrukere?
Vi ønsket en løsning som gjorde det mulig å flytte nett og mobilbanken fra gammel til ny stack, dvs både ny drifts-infrastruktur, men også en ny kodebase , et skjermbilde av gangen, uten at sluttbruker merket noe og at hvert enkelt team i størst mulig grad kunne være selvbetjent når det kom til endringer for deres kodebase og skjermbilder.</description>

I denne presentasjonen skal vi gå gjennom hvordan DDoS-angrep oppleves hos NRK.no og hvordan vi prøver å minske konsekvensene når angrepene skjer. Vi skal også se at ikke alle angrep er fiendtlige eller kommer utenifra.</description>

      <description>Software packaging and distribution is a very simple value proposition, and a surprisingly rich and complex problem underneath. There is a myriad of systems available, and in this workshop will have a closer look at a few common ones. We will go through the stages of building and packaging, and move from a hand-packaged tarball, through dpkg/apt, to the deeply programmable packaging systems guix and nix. All work and no play makes a dull shop, so it is recommended to bring a computer with some tools installed (see list at the end).</description>

      <description>We’ve all been the newcomer; on the team, in the domain, in the industry. We don’t know if something is vitally important or a minor detail. When is it OK to ask for help? When do you become “productive”? More knowledge is always better, right?
Being a newcomer is an asset! How can we leverage the potential of our newest colleagues in a good way, and create a better working place for everyone at the same time?</description>

      <description>I 2020 ble en utvikler dømt i Bergen tingrett for datainnbrudd etter at han hadde benyttet seg av et API hos Statens Vegvesen for å laste ned offentlig data. Dette er en sak som fortsatt sitter friskt i minne for mange, og som datajournalist tenker jeg på den hver gang jeg oppsøker offentlig data.
Utvikleren anket og ble til slutt frikjent, men hva hadde skjedd om han hadde brukt de samme metodene for datainnsamling som norsk presse benytter seg av daglig?</description>

      <description>Det skulle være kjempegøy! Jeg skulle bringe designtanker inn i en veldig techorientert bedrift. Mange spennende utfordringer ventet på meg. What could possibly go wrong? Vel, faktisk ganske mye. Tenk motstand, konflikter, blod, svette og tårer. Kom og hør på skrekkhistoriene, men også det gøye som kan komme ut av å prøve å få to veldig forskjellige verdener til å møtes!</description>

      <description>En verden uten uenighet og konflikt, ville det vært fredelig eller bare kjedelig? Vi tror at det meste som er kult er tuftet på litt konflikt. Det startet med noen uforenlige mål, som konflikt ganske enkelt er. Så har noen jobbet med konflikten, stått i det, mestret det og funnet en (kanskje helt ny) løsning. En forutsetning for at team skal arbeide effektivt og resultatene bli bra, er gode og stabile relasjoner.</description>

Recently, we revamped our design system and have explored ways of propagating these updates throughout our products, across different stacks. We aim to inspire others by sharing the pitfalls and best practices we have discovered during our journey.</description>

      <description>Har du noen gang jobbet med en MVP som bare vokser og vokser i omfang? Kanskje oppleves MVP bare som en annen måte å snakke om den endelige løsningen dere skal bygge? Eller kanskje begrepet brukes om hvilken funksjonalitet som skal med i neste release&amp;hellip;
Jeg er en stor forkjemper for MVP, men opplever dessverre at begrepet ofte blir misbrukt. Hva er egentlig &amp;ldquo;minimal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;viable&amp;rdquo; og &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; i produktet vi utvikler?</description>

Passwords has been the de-facto authorization mechanism since before the cracking of the Forty Thieves, but nowadays there are several alternatives that could help keeping your hideout safe from Ali Babas hacking skills.</description>

      <description>How many concurrent users can does your application handle? Or your platform infrastructure? What if they try uploading enormous files? Does your application reply fast enough? Does load balancing and scaling work and respond quickly when your application is flooded with requests from users checking their tax return, buying ice cream on the 17th of May, or vote for their favorite Eurovision contestant?
Downtime or users experiencing a slow application at a critical point in time can lead to both financial and reputational loss.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to become good at a skill which, for many of us, is only a minor part of our jobs: holding presentations. However, it’s important. Making and delivering a good presentation may take more time for you than making a quick, sloppy presentation, but if it’s bad enough it may be a complete waste of time for your entire audience. So lets go through some tips for how to be on a stage and hold a presentation without letting your nerves get the better of you.</description>

      <description>Today’s development process is widely based upon agile methodology. Implementation of feature flags is listed as one of DevOps best practices. Approaches to testing have changed a lot lately and only few dev teams are lucky enough to have dedicated tester/QA. Automated tests are good, but you cannot automate everything. Bugs are still existing, and testers must prioritise wisely. That’s why I think that progressive delivery with feature flags helps us on daily basis to work more efficient and to have control over our deliveries.</description>

      <description>The Commodore Amiga was the worlds best home computer until 1994. It had fantastic graphics capabilities, great games, and you could even do homework on it if you wanted (yeah right).
Ricki stopped using his Amiga back in the 90s, but recently retreived it from the attic again after spending a couple of years developing games for the even older Commodore 64. He has been developing a new Amiga game the last 1.</description>

      <description>Throughout the years, once in a while, I&amp;rsquo;d hear people refer to an exercise called &amp;ldquo;Elephant Carpaccio&amp;rdquo;. And yet I never ran into someone actually facilitating the exercise, allowing me to participate. So I ended up doing the next best thing: I ran it a few times myself, with some of my colleagues as benevolent participants / test subjects. Also, it was fully remote.
In this lightning talk I&amp;rsquo;ll share why I like &amp;ldquo;Elephant Carpaccio&amp;rdquo; so much and how I went about facilitating the exercise without ever having done it myself.</description>

      <description>You have probably heard security professionals talk about patching vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks and OWASP top 10. These security issues are usually due to our most well-known software defect: bugs! But today we will focus on another kind of software defect: design flaws! We&amp;rsquo;re going to look at how to make our code more secure to begin with, so that less vulnerabilities fall out on the other side when you shake your system.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is BÃ¥rd. No, actually, my name is Bård. That is a four letter name. so short and easy you would think even a robot or a child would spell it correctly. Growing up online with a character in my name that’s not found in the first 127 bytes of unicode, I have been predisposed to be interested in the odd ways of character encoding. Join me in a journey into the maze of character encoding, and the many ways it can go wrong.</description>

      <description>Code reviews are not just a technical exercise but also a human interaction, often bringing into play a delicate balance between critique and emotion. While the aim is to improve code quality, an overlooked aspect is the impact it can have on developers&amp;rsquo; morale and team dynamics. This lightning talk explores the fine line between providing constructive criticism and hurting someone’s feelings. How can you be candid and effective in your feedback without demoralizing your colleagues?</description>

      <description>During this thought-provoking and fun workshop we will obtain the skills of giving a feedback that encourages to grow and succeed. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the &amp;ldquo;learning by doing&amp;rdquo; approach, thus there will be a lot of activities and very little teaching in a workshop. Attendants will leave a room with a set of tools that will become handy already that same day.</description>

Av alle disse kampene, hvordan kan vi være sikker på at riktig kamp vises til riktig person?</description>

Å lykkes med rekruttering, å lykkes med onboarding, å lykkes med å få juniorer til å bli seniorer.</description>

      <description>This year’s walk and talk will be up mount Ulriken. With its elevation of 643 meters Ulriken is the highest of the seven mountains surrounding Bergen. Mount Ulriken is great for hiking and of course a perfect spot for a tech talk with the amazing view over the city.
The hike starts at the ulriken lower station and are well marked all the way up with signs. The main part consists of great stone-built stairs built by Sherpas from Nepal.</description>

      <description>I am a web designer who enjoys working somewhere inbetween design and code, mostly with large-scale web portals and design systems.

      <title>Which qualities?</title>

      <description>We all focus on delivering high quality code, don&amp;rsquo;t we? But what do we mean by this?
Developers often think it is implied what high quality code means, but I find that we value different qualities. And, let me tell you a secret: You can&amp;rsquo;t have them all! You actually have to choose which qualities are important for you, your team, your situation.
I will strike a blow for always talking about qualities in plural, and deliberately choosing which qualities you will invest in, and which you will not.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you just sketch something quickly?&amp;rdquo; is a question all UX-designers have gotten at least once in their career. Most will experience a mildly frustrated answer in return. Why is that? Why can&amp;rsquo;t we UX-designers &amp;ldquo;just sketch something quick&amp;rdquo;? In this lightning session, I will give an introduction to what UX-design really is, and how and why we make our choices.</description>

      <description>The aim of this lightning talk is to make the listener more self aware on how they can become a better team member, a better colleague and a better person.
The talk is based on a model by Ofman (2000) where he describes the core quadrant that will provide insight into a person&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. The model consists of four parts. Firstly, your CORE QUALITY which is part of your strength as a person.</description>

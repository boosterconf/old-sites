      <description>I’m an architect, and I think a lot about architecture. Mostly I think about how irrelevant architecture is if it doesn’t get shipped to production. I worry a lot too. I worry about how to help all the teams I’m supposed to be helping, without slowing them down, getting in their way, or making their lives harder rather than easier.
Traditional (i.e. hands-off, blessed-few) approaches to architecture rarely (if ever) work.</description>

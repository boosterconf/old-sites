      <description>What are poems, if not elegantly encoded experiences captured in compact text?
Unlike A.I. systems, we humans can take fuzzy knowledge from wholly different fields and apply them elsewhere. In this workshop I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you to the field of poetry with the goal of yielding some fresh perspectives on both writing and programming.
Maybe the worlds of code and poems lie too far afield to inspire each other, or maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something there that can spark better, clearer, more succinct writing?</description>

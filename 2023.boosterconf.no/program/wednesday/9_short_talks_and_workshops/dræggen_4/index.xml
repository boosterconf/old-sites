      <description>Within the community of coders &amp;ldquo;being an architect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;doing architecture&amp;rdquo; is often looked down upon. When referring to architecture we often mean drawings of boxes and arrows that are pointless and have not relation to what is really being done.
However, architecture can also be defined as the important decision, whatever they are (https://martinfowler.com/architecture/). There always are important decisions and the code only contains the how and not the why.</description>

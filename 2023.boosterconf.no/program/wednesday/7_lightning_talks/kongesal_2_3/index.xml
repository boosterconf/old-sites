      <description>Programming languages has evolved a lot from the early days, and yet many of the ideas from early programming languages keep inspiring new languages. Simula was invited in Norway in the 60¬¥s as a language for doing simulations, but is best remembers as the language that introduced the consept of Object Oriented Programming. But Simula was also one of the first languages to introduce Coroutines for doing asynchronous programming. So why didn¬¥t Simula become a mainstream programming language?</description>

I want to talk about how we approach this in our organization. First, you need to create ownership to these sessions.</description>

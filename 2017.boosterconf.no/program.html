          <span class='author'>Pawel  Brodzinski</span>
          
          <div class='description'><p>When we think about self-organization the obvious context is a team. Everyone in the Agile world have heard about self-organized teams. We expect a boost of engagement and productivity when people aren&rsquo;t told how to organize themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, despite all the benefits we see at a team level, almost no organizations try to scale the concept of self-organization up. The reason is the hierarchical power distribution structure that is at the core of almost all organizations. We commonly call it management. Introducing self-organization throughout the organization would require to redesign how it is managed. Is it even possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me walk you through that story. At Lunar Logic in less than 4 years we evolved from a traditional organizational model with strong management to fully self-organized company. Our CEO has equal access to information and equal decision-making power as an intern who we hired last month. We have no managers and are in need of none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not crazy, mind you. The company didn&rsquo;t collapse. Conversely, the retention has improved, motivation went through the roof, and financially the company has never been more stable as it is now. While I won&rsquo;t lie that it&rsquo;s been easy, the outcomes speak for themselves.</p></div>

        <h5>Getting started with Elm and typed functional programming
          <span class="parts">
        </span>
        </h5>
        <span class='author'>Ingar Almklov and Erik Wendel</span>
        
        <div class='description'><p>Elm is a typed, functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.&nbsp;It's famous for ensuring robust applications, and Elms wildly developer friendly compiler helps developers write elegant, long-lived and safe frontend code. It has recently started drawing widespread attention and is starting&nbsp;to position itself as something other compile-to-js languages hasn't achieved yet - a viable alternative to JavaScript.<br /><br />Elm utilizes a React-like&nbsp;rendering system, using a tree of pure view functions, while structuring its app using the so-called Redux architecture (which Redux actually borrowed from Elm in the first place). All data is immutable, of course, and the language supports fancy features such as algebraic data types, pattern matching and type inference.<br /><br />Did this pique your interest? We're the organizers of&nbsp;the Oslo Elm Meetup group are we're bringing our&nbsp;workshop material to Bergen to get you started with Elm. This includes a thorough explanation of syntax and semantics with comparison to JavaScript. The workshop&nbsp;also serves as a introduction to ML-style typed functional programming, and after this workshop you'll be able to judge for yourself whether a language like Elm could ever replace JavaScript as our go-to tool for large-scale web development.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<p>Bring your own laptop with Elm 0.18 (<span class="s2"><a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html">https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html</a>) and Elm-format (<span class="s2"><a href="https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#for-elm-018">https://github.com/avh4/elm-format</a>) installed.</span></span></p>

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications bult upon Google's experience running containers on a large scale. Through the&nbsp;workshop the participant will&nbsp;become familiar with creating, running, managing, and updating applications on Kubernetes. Experience with Docker is not required to benefit the workshop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The workshop starts with deploying a typical monolith application, then we'll add a SSL on top of it before we expose the application.&nbsp;We'll then break down the monolith in it's basic components and deploy, and update, them as individual&nbsp;services. This brings out the true power of the Kubernetes platform.</span></p></div>

<p>This workshop is for everyone who wishes to provide their users with a secure service, both you who think "enable SSL" is enough, but also for the perfectionist hunting for A+ at SSL Labs. The workshop walks through configuring your servers to be good Internet citizens.

<p>This will be a hands-on workshop teaching you how to set up TLS, Content-Security-Policy and other security headers, as well as what pitfalls to avoid. Along the way we'll show how to abuse incorrectly configured sites, and how&nbsp;to secure them.</p>

Next, using options thinking to frame work will be explored and how to use starting and stopping triggers for options, reducing the need of blind budgeting or project practices. Finally, Matt will wrap up by touching on a few key metrics that will let you monitor and evaluate your new road map.</p>

        <div class='description'><p>Elm is a typed, functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.&nbsp;It's famous for ensuring robust applications, and Elms wildly developer friendly compiler helps developers write elegant, long-lived and safe frontend code. It has recently started drawing widespread attention and is starting&nbsp;to position itself as something other compile-to-js languages hasn't achieved yet - a viable alternative to JavaScript.<br /><br />Elm utilizes a React-like&nbsp;rendering system, using a tree of pure view functions, while structuring its app using the so-called Redux architecture (which Redux actually borrowed from Elm in the first place). All data is immutable, of course, and the language supports fancy features such as algebraic data types, pattern matching and type inference.<br /><br />Did this pique your interest? We're the organizers of&nbsp;the Oslo Elm Meetup group are we're bringing our&nbsp;workshop material to Bergen to get you started with Elm. This includes a thorough explanation of syntax and semantics with comparison to JavaScript. The workshop&nbsp;also serves as a introduction to ML-style typed functional programming, and after this workshop you'll be able to judge for yourself whether a language like Elm could ever replace JavaScript as our go-to tool for large-scale web development.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<p>Bring your own laptop with Elm 0.18 (<span class="s2"><a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html">https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html</a>) and Elm-format (<span class="s2"><a href="https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#for-elm-018">https://github.com/avh4/elm-format</a>) installed.</span></span></p>

        <div class='description'><p>Sketching is a crucial skill that spans all job titles. It helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating our ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, our ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching and become a sketching machine. Come prepared to do fun sketching activities so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand.</p>

<p>In the process you will get to know the latest version of the Inuitcss framework, version 6. It brings a whole bunch of improvements and makes it easier to get started with.</p>
<p><strong>In this workshop you are going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to structure your SCSS so that you and your team have more control</li>
<li>How to avoid the specificity-monster in CSS</li>
<li>How to work with modules in your design and how this makes development and prototyping easier</li>
<li>How to handle complex, responsive layouts in CSS</li>

<p>&ldquo;It is the recognition that well-read is not a destination, there is nowhere to get to and if there was somewhere to get to, you would need a thousand years to even think about getting there.&rdquo; -Linda Holmes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people strive to be &ldquo;well-read&rdquo; as developers or designers, they want to know &amp; do it all. But why? All in the name of being &ldquo;well-read&rdquo;? All just to say &ldquo;Yeah &mdash; I&rsquo;ve done that&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Why do we do what we do? Why do we try so hard? Why are we here, paying to be here, to listen to people talk? Maybe because we&rsquo;re life long learners - we want to learn new things? Commune with our own kind? But why? Come examine our motives as developers, the pitfalls we fall into, and the cost of being great.</p></div>

Rather, it is a third-order effect of poor communication. It is a symptom of an underlying lack of appropriate abstractions, which in turn stems from insufficient modelling of the problem domain. In order to avoid technical bankrupcy, therefore, we must improve the way we build our understanding of the problem we are trying to solve.</p></div>

Metrics such as traffic speeds, volumes, patterns and trends heavily influence how roads should be built and maintained. Improving the data quality of your metrics means you can plan and execute roadwork more efficiently.<br /><br />We have built an infrastructure consisting of distributed sensors and signal processing devices, a data ingestion application, and a NoSQL database optimized for analytics. The system registers information about vehicles passing measurement stations located along major roads in Norway and provides continuously updated reports and low-latency traffic event information.<br /><br />While building the system and integrating it with an increasing number of measurement stations, we have encountered a wide variety of architectural challenges. We believe the main reasons are: a very diverse technology stack, a need for continuously cost-effective scalability, and a desire to keep the architecture simple and agile.<br /><br />The presentation will go through a selection of challenges we have met and provide our thoughts and reasoning behind the choices we made underway. Outcomes, both positive and negative, intended and unintended, will be discussed.</p></div>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there: trying to anticipate design feedback before it happens, drafting responses in our heads, dreading the possibility that our work could be destroyed in a mere 30 minutes. Defending work and ensuring that a design remains intact through a design review can be a challenging endeavor, and in many ways, it requires a specific and thought-out approach. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll discuss the best ways for designers to silence their stakeholders, defend their designs during reviews, and ultimately get exactly what they want. It&rsquo;s time that designers start enforcing their expertise, standing up for their work, and ensuring that it sees the light of day. Right?</p>

By putting data at the forefront and focusing on data-centric architectures, one can establish a platform for building data-driven products, make decisions based on the data, and ultimately take control of the increasing amounts of generated data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop will be focused on learning the concepts and building a real-time data streaming architecture with Apache Kafka as the main Data Hub. We will start with a good overview on data-centric architectures, Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, and the data modeling process. We will reserve a large chunk of time for hands-on deployment of the different components, and will be doing interactive data exploration using Jupyter Notebooks (in Python). The aim is to enable you to build applications that take advantage of the low latency, real-time aspect of the architecture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The participants of the workshop will also use Ansible, AWS, and Docker to prepare the workshop environment, after a short introduction to the tools needed. This will not be the main focus of the workshop, but is needed to get started quickly.</span></p>

        <h5>Visual prototyping and concept development for project managers and developers

        </span>
        </h5>
        <span class='author'>Steinar Dragsnes and Erling Andreas Arnestad and Alexander Valland Strømme</span>
        
        <div class='description'><div>
<div>Visual prototyping is an efficient and cost effective tool to explore concepts and design directions. As opposed to diving right in coding, exploring ideas with simple prototypes will lead to a better solution. Visual prototyping is also an effective way of communicating thoughts and ideas by eliminating the need to explain things through text and words.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>In concept development, ideas need to be quickly visualised. Ideas that seem solid might not necessarily work when visualised in a prototype. Drawing the solution also aids concept development and often the best ideas materialise when the solution is visualised.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Historically visual prototyping has been the domain of designers. We believe that by teaching both project managers and developers how to better visually communicate their concepts, we will have a richer exchange of ideas, and ensure the best possible transfer of knowledge within the team.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>In this workshop we will look at how prototyping is used for concept development. We will start with a concrete business story and describe the support systems, data and problems. The participants will then use their newly acquired skills developing solutions addressing the users' real needs. The goal of the workshop is to show how to make better solutions through concept development. Participants will also gain confidence communicating with visual aids. Simple visual communication tools such as sketching with pen and paper, and using Balsamiq for quick and simple prototypes will be used.</div>

Janet shares her experiences in how testing activities change in an agile environment, and what skills testers need to enhance their team&rsquo;s ability to deliver a quality product. If your team doesn&rsquo;t have a tester, then this is an opportunity for you to learn the benefits of testing activities such as exploratory testing as part of the whole team approach to delivering quality. &nbsp;Participants will have an opportunity to practice their skills at some of these testing activities.</p>

        <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring the treasure trove of (Big) Data is essential for companies to survive the increasingly competitive landscape. By putting data at the forefront and focusing on data-centric architectures, one can establish a platform for building data-driven products, make decisions based on the data, and ultimately take control of the increasing amounts of generated data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop will be focused on learning the concepts and building a real-time data streaming architecture with Apache Kafka as the main Data Hub. We will start with a good overview on data-centric architectures, Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, and the data modeling process. We will reserve a large chunk of time for hands-on deployment of the different components, and will be doing interactive data exploration using Jupyter Notebooks (in Python). The aim is to enable you to build applications that take advantage of the low latency, real-time aspect of the architecture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The participants of the workshop will also use Ansible, AWS, and Docker to prepare the workshop environment, after a short introduction to the tools needed. This will not be the main focus of the workshop, but is needed to get started quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important topics / technologies covered:</span></p>

          <span class="parts">
            (cont.)
        </span>
        </h5>
        <span class='author'>Steinar Dragsnes and Erling Andreas Arnestad and Alexander Valland Strømme</span>
        
        <div class='description'><div>
<div>Visual prototyping is an efficient and cost effective tool to explore concepts and design directions. As opposed to diving right in coding, exploring ideas with simple prototypes will lead to a better solution. Visual prototyping is also an effective way of communicating thoughts and ideas by eliminating the need to explain things through text and words.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>In concept development, ideas need to be quickly visualised. Ideas that seem solid might not necessarily work when visualised in a prototype. Drawing the solution also aids concept development and often the best ideas materialise when the solution is visualised.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Historically visual prototyping has been the domain of designers. We believe that by teaching both project managers and developers how to better visually communicate their concepts, we will have a richer exchange of ideas, and ensure the best possible transfer of knowledge within the team.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>In this workshop we will look at how prototyping is used for concept development. We will start with a concrete business story and describe the support systems, data and problems. The participants will then use their newly acquired skills developing solutions addressing the users' real needs. The goal of the workshop is to show how to make better solutions through concept development. Participants will also gain confidence communicating with visual aids. Simple visual communication tools such as sketching with pen and paper, and using Balsamiq for quick and simple prototypes will be used.</div>

        <div class='description'><div>Conversations on the topic of branching, especially to branch or not to branch, tend to be heated and opinionated. In order to level the playing field we start off by defining the ballpark to play in:</div>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>Firstly we define what we mean by branching</li>
<li>Secondly we define which contexts to base the discussion from (Co-located teams? Distributed teams? Open Source?)</li>
<li>Thirdly we agree on the definition of Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Fourthly we talk about the technology value stream.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Then we are ready to have a meaningful discussion of how branching impacts the flow of work inside the technology value stream, what Trunk Based Development REALLY is and why companies like Google and Facebook don't do branching. In the end you will have enough information to make a well founded decision about branching in your company.</div></div>

        <div class='description'><p>You have (probably?) heard about accessibility ("universell utforming" in Norwegian), but do you know what it is? How to use it and how to design,&nbsp;develop and test for it? No? Then this is the workshop for you! And even if you are experienced and know what a11y stands for, you might pick up a trick or two.</p>
<p>At some point or another in life, we will all have some form of disability or limited functionality, whether our eyesight worsens, we break an arm or we loose mobililty when we get older. At that point accessibility, or universal design, is going to become very important for our ability to participate in society. And even if we luck out and escape such problems, we all benefit from accessible tools.</p>
<p>If that is not enough, universal design of all websites is enforced by law in Norway since July 1st 2014. For all of us working in the software development business, accessibility is among the most neccessary skills we have, and it is critical that we learn it.</p>
<p>This workshop will guide you through the different phases of software development: concept, design, implementation and testing. You will learn the basics for each phase and&nbsp;we will use hands-on experience and group discussions to&nbsp;learn some of the more important skills we need.&nbsp;You will not only learn what you need to do to create an accessible website, but you will experience what happens if you don't.</p>
<p>The workshop is open for people from all roles of software development, from&nbsp;UX to developers to testers. Even if you do not "know about the technical stuff", you will still learn a thing or two that you can bring back to work after the conference, and the tasks are set up so that you can follow them without being able to code.&nbsp;You will learn about&nbsp;WAI-ARIA, why #04e51e and #f5fc32 should never mingle and how to use a screen reader.</p></div>

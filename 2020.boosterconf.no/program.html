                            </h4>
            <span class='author'>Niklas Modig</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p>Efficiency is misunderstood concept. We tend over focus on individual, team or functional performance. As a consequence, we often sub-optimize our organizations by developing &ldquo;efficient islands".</p>
<p>Research shows that island thinking can be extremely problematic. Even if our metrics and KPIs indicate that all islands are efficient, the company as a whole is usually not! The more we try to squeeze out from each island the more we will loose sight of our customers. This will in turn develop a situation where the organization lacks understanding of the big picture and what true value creation is.</p>
<p>In fact, the more efficient islands we have, the more inefficient our organisations will be.</p>
<p>During this keynote Niklas will explain how to resolve this efficiency paradox.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>A lot of programming nowadays has been reduced to Jira tasks, predictable processes, and high-level languages. Let&rsquo;s step away from that and have some low-level fun with one of the most iconic computers ever made!</p>
<p>In this workshop we will teach you how to get started with game programming on the Commodore 64. This machine was released in 1982 and was one of the most popular home computers of the 1980's.</p>
<p>But why would you want to do anything on 38-year-old hardware? Because it is easy to get started and is super fun! Plus, you get to reap the rewards of decades of hacking on this machine. Kids from the 80s that are now grown-ups, and also new generations of youngsters have been finding new tricks and cool features since it was introduced. And since the advent of the internet, they have been documenting everything on the internet. The Commodore 64 still has a vibrant developer community to this day, with games still being released!</p>
<p>We won't be programming on an actual C64, but rather on modern hardware, with a modern editor with a cross compiler and an emulator with debugging capabilities. This turns the process into a fun adventure, where we learn what assembly is and how to manipulate the old hardware with it.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to learn how to get started making games on a Commodore 64 in assembly. You will also learn what a cross-compiler does, how the hardware works, and how fun it is to try something completely new(old!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ricki Sickenger</strong> is a former professional game developer with 10 years experience, now working as an IT consultant and hobby game developer.</p>
<p><strong>John Christian L&oslash;nningdal</strong> has released several C64 games in recent years, but his day job is working as an IT consultant.</p>
<p>They both love retro games and the Commodore 64!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the retro programming workshop!</p></div>

Its popularity has increased steadily the past few years after more and more cloud products such as Docker and Kubernetes, and big-scale companies such as Uber, Netflix, Dropbox and Twitter has gone all-in on Go and enjoying the ride.<br /><br />This workshop will focus on learning the language, its syntax and its weirdness (in a good way), while making a few microservices that communicate with each other over gRPC and HTTP. Learning by doing in other words. We'll move fast and assume you know other programming languages and are able to connect the dots based on your already excellent knowledge and awesome programming skills. Go is a famously easy language to learn due to its extreme pragmatism and we'll put that to the test here.<br /><br />Things you'll learn:</p>
<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre"><br />* How Go differs from other object oriented C-like languages like Java, C#, Python and JavaScript<br />* Language syntax that are different from other languages<br />* Communicate between Go applications using HTTP/REST and gRPC<br />* Running multiple Go applications in Docker and Docker Compose<br /><br />Things we won't cover:</p>

<p class="c-mrkdwn__pre" data-stringify-type="pre"><br />* Install Go (and ensure "go" is on your path). If you already have Go installed, check for updates<br />* Install Docker (and ensure "docker" and "docker-compose" is on your path). If you already have Docker installed, check for updates<br />* Bring your laptop<br />* Bring your laptop charger<br />* Have a GitHub account (and Git installed on your computer)<br />* Bring an IDE that understands Go. The best free alternative is Visual Studio Code with a plugin. The best-best alternative is GoLand from JetBrains. IntelliJ also have a Go plugin that gives a GoLand-like experience.<br />* Double-check that laptop charger</p>

<p>Have you never used git, or even other revision control systems?</p>
<p>Typically, a git conflict comes at the worst time possible: you are done with you work, and you just want it to be merged so that you can either go home, or start on something new. &nbsp;And on top of that, you are afraid of losing your work that you might have spent weeks on.</p>
<p>We never really practice our git workflows, we often just end up slaves to the tool. &nbsp;I'll be your guide through the git workflow and we will be resolving the conflicts, coming out on the other side as no longer mere mortals, but true gitters.</p>
<p>Target group: people who either haven't used git yet or trembles prior to merging.</p>
<p>It is ambitious, but the goal is to, during these three hours, to get to know these commands:</p>
<p>* init<br />* log<br />* status<br />* diff<br />* show<br />* add<br />* commit<br />* reset<br />* clean<br />* rm<br />* mv<br />* restore<br />* stash<br />* tag<br />* blame<br />* filter-branch<br />* bisect<br />* branch<br />* checkout<br />* switch(?)<br />* merge<br />* rebase<br />* cherry-pick<br />* reflog<br />* clone<br />* remote<br />* push<br />* fetch<br />* pull</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>Are you embarrassed to say that you don't really know what to do when git screams "CONFLICT"? Or that you don't really know what the different commands do?</p>
<p>Have you never used git, or even other revision control systems?</p>
<p>Typically, a git conflict comes at the worst time possible: you are done with you work, and you just want it to be merged so that you can either go home, or start on something new. &nbsp;And on top of that, you are afraid of losing your work that you might have spent weeks on.</p>
<p>We never really practice our git workflows, we often just end up slaves to the tool. &nbsp;I'll be your guide through the git workflow and we will be resolving the conflicts, coming out on the other side as no longer mere mortals, but true gitters.</p>
<p>Target group: people who either haven't used git yet or trembles prior to merging.</p>
<p>It is ambitious, but the goal is to, during these three hours, to get to know these commands:</p>
<p>* init<br />* log<br />* status<br />* diff<br />* show<br />* add<br />* commit<br />* reset<br />* clean<br />* rm<br />* mv<br />* restore<br />* stash<br />* tag<br />* blame<br />* filter-branch<br />* bisect<br />* branch<br />* checkout<br />* switch(?)<br />* merge<br />* rebase<br />* cherry-pick<br />* reflog<br />* clone<br />* remote<br />* push<br />* fetch<br />* pull</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>A transformation or change to a team, department or organisation, doesn&rsquo;t have to be based on a traditional framework. In fact, every organisation will have a different context based around existing culture and the value proposition, so why should we state that a few frameworks or a term such as Agile can fit every scenario.</p>
<p>There is value in agility, there are benefits to frameworks. Change most definitely needs to be controlled, but when you are dealing with existing processes, the layers of organisational culture and people in general, ideas which sound good now can have unintended consequences and more importantly ideas not considered initially are often the ones that enable the team, department or organisation to stand out above the rest.</p>
<p>During this workshop we will be using a structured approach to allow attendees to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a structure on how to control change</li>
<li>Limit risk whilst also having the ability to take advantage of unseen opportunities.</li>
<li>Become part of a fictional company and experience this structure and change occurring</li>
<li>Understand some of the participants own organisational issues, enabling quality conversations and structure outside of the workshop and back in the attendee&rsquo;s own team, department or organisation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
<p>This workshop is designed so that you will be looking from your own sphere of influence and as such whether you&rsquo;re a corporate CEO or just starting a career you should leave with additional confidence in implementing change relevant to yourself.</p>
<p>All you need, is a desire to make a positive change to the world around you.</p>

Among its many selling points are ease of learning and quick re-renders without a virtual DOM. Current big-name users include The New York Times and Godaddy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this workshop you will learn the basics of Svelte by implementing some simple games. Each game will teach different aspects of Svelte, such as animation, reactivity, data fetching and storage. You will be taught by an enthusiastic frontender who has used Svelte both at work and for hobby projects for the last nine months. The workshop is suitable for both frontenders and designers who can code. </span></p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Svelte is a promising, novel approach to Javascript, designed for speed, short source files and tiny bundles. Among its many selling points are ease of learning and quick re-renders without a virtual DOM. Current big-name users include The New York Times and Godaddy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this workshop you will learn the basics of Svelte by implementing some simple games. Each game will teach different aspects of Svelte, such as animation, reactivity, data fetching and storage. You will be taught by an enthusiastic frontender who has used Svelte both at work and for hobby projects for the last nine months. The workshop is suitable for both frontenders and designers who can code. </span></p></div>

              <span class="parts">

            </h5>
            <span class='author'>Vegard Haugstvedt</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p>During the fall of 2019, I worked on a really unique project. I was to build a website (a webshop, actually), that was to be fully accessible, and then add as many accessibility bugs as possible. Sound weird? It was! It was also really fun, and I learned a lot. And all of it was implemented in just over a month!</p>
<p>The inspiration for the project was W3C's "Before and After Demonstration" (&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/">https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/</a> ), where you can switch between accessible and inaccessible versions of five types of webpages. But the design of these are old fashioned, the functionality limited and in general the website was not very relatable as the calendar approached 2020.</p>
<p>So we set out to build a more modern version, with the lofty goal of being "the new gold standard for accessibility", a site where users could test complete scenarios and one that could be used both in education and for verifying how many issues automated accessibility testing tools can find.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will share our journey with you, exploring different accessibility issues, user testing, changing requirements and other topics we encountered.</p></div>

<p>We look into the crystal ball and make some qualified guesses about the future, specifically about Kubernetes as a future container platform and which essential requirements are typically missing from today's serverless cloud offerings.</p>

And we would like to know if they are going to fail before they fail; otherwise, we lose a lot of money. Since we happen to have so many machines, we can not apply traditional data-science, which is focused on making an awesome model for a single problem. We need to build and deploy thousands of adequate models automatically. In order to do this we have created the open-source project Gordo with the goal of building and serving thousands of machine learning models. Nobody else uses it, but if you happen to have thousands of machines, millions of time-series, a big kubernetes budget, and the need for anomaly detection or predictions, maybe you should start using it?</span></p></div>

For me, it was that I wanted to learn in a more useful way than doing programming challenges. So I looked into how I could contribute to open source projects that I use myself.<br />After contributing for almost two years, I notice that I have learned a lot from my contributions (which has been useful at work), as well as have made friends and have become part of a community. <br /><br />In this talk I will share my experience with contributing to Cucumber, including an early mistake (merging something that wasn&rsquo;t ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core maintainers, and still feeling welcome!<br />You&rsquo;ll learn how how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful and the many different types of contributions you can make.<br /><br />Contributing to open source is a way of giving back to the community. In addition, it is a way for you to learn, collaborate and become part of a community. Getting (constructive) feedback on a pull request and collaborating to make things even better is a great feeling! </pre></div>

Unfortunately, underground stops seem to scare the life out of people: Some people feel trapped, others are afraid of assault, and some are simply afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>So how can we make people feel safe in underground stations? And is it possible to test out different concepts in order to see the effect, before construction has even begun?</p>
<p>Through a number of workshops, I have been challenging the concept of underground stations, and I am now about to carry out user tests in VR in order to collect user feedback. Soon, I expect to get answers to numerous questions, among these: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>* What are you actually testing, when doing user tests in VR?</p>
<p>* Does a VR experience have to be truly immersive in order to comprehend a concept?</p>
<p>* And does it really make sense to prototype a building?</p>
<p>If you are as curious as me, when it comes to interaction design, user research, exploring more or less far out design concepts, and user testing in VR, then come to my talk!</p></div>

<p>In this workshop we will teach the basics of electronics and synthesizer design. To keep it old-school, we will focus on analog electronics, and to keep it manageable we will make a "non-musical" synthesizer. In other words a noisy box perfect for creating interesting sound effects and alerting your colleagues of impending meetings. We will build the different parts of the synthesizer on breadboard to get an understand of how they work, and the students will get a PCB to solder permanently. Parts will be provided.</p>
<div>The workshop will be 3 hours.</div>

<div>We will cover:</div>
<div>- Basic electronics and use of prototyping tools</div>
<div>- Basic signal processing</div>
<div>- Basic synthesizer design<br /><br /><br />Basic electronics skills are helpful, but the course is designed for beginners</div></div>

            </h5>
            <span class='author'>Hans Kristian Flaatten and Fredrick Myrvoll</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p>Microservices describes the promised land where each service can be implemented completely independent of any other service using any programming language and any framework? But is that even possible? How do we ensure that all services are secure and protected? How do we make sure we can know what is going on inside and between the different services? How do we ensure propper handling of errors when communicating across multiple services? How do we trace errors back to the service that caused it?</p>
<p>In a traditional microservices environment these questions must be solved individually by each service or require the use of several libraries and suddenly your "micro"-service wasn't quite as micro and you most certainly can no longer use the programming language or framework you want any more.</p>
<p>What if there was a better way of managing all these microservices and be able to preserve their individuality and without having to bundle all of the complexity into the code?</p>
<h4>The workshop will cover the following:</h4>
<p>* Setting up the Istio Service Mesh on Kubernetes</p>
<p>* Deploying our all of the individual microservices required for our webshop application</p>
<p>* Routing traffic with the Istio Ingress Controller</p>
<p>* Monitoring performance with Grafana</p>
<p>* Observing traffic flow with Kiali</p>
<p>* Distributed Tracing with OpenTracing and Jaeger</p>
<p>* Request Routing and Canary Deployments</p>
<p>* Fault Injection and Rate Limiting</p>
<p>* Service Isolation Using the Istio Mixer</p>
<p>* Securing all communication with mutial encryption (mTLS)</p>
<h4>What you will need to bring to the workshop:</h4>
<p>* A laptop</p>
<p>* Enthusiasm 😅</p>
<h4>Nice to have</h4>
<p>* Basic understanding of how microservices communicate and are deployed</p>
<p>* Basic understanding of containers and Kubernetes&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class='description'><h4><strong>Say hello to The Things Network.</strong></h4>
<p>It's an open, crowdsourced, and encrypted wireless IoT network that aims to solve the wireless hurdles of limited range, excessive power consumption, and high operational cost using game-changing LoraWAN technology.</p>
<p>Twelve months after its launch in Bergen, The Things Network has snowballed. Close to thirty gateways spread throughout the city provide wireless coverage in most of the densely populated areas. Every day, thousands of data packets are transmitted from the hundreds of sensors deployed in the area. Maybe the next one will be yours?</p>
<p>In this workshop, you will learn everything you need to get started with The Things Network, LoraWAN, and crowdsourced &nbsp;IoT. We will provide you with your very own LoRa-ready microcontroller. If you are lucky, you might get the opportunity to take it home with you, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>We will cover</strong></h4>
<p>&ndash; The Things Network and LoraWAN explained &ndash; how it works, and how you can use it in your projects (for fun and profit).<br />&ndash; Fair usage and duty cycle limitations.&nbsp;<br />&ndash; Spreading factors, data rates and bandwidth.<br />&ndash; Different network activation methods and when to use them: Activation by Personalisation (ABP) versus Over The Air Activation (OTAA).<br />&ndash; Case study: TTN Mapper.<br />&ndash; The Things Network Console: How to register your free account, configure your applications, and set up data forwarding to external endpoints.<br />&ndash; "Hello, world!": Your first and simple The Things Network application.<br />&ndash; Raw data payload decoding and port routing.<br />&ndash; IoT thermometer: Air temperature readings over the air.<br />&ndash; Bonus: Setup TTN Mapper and start mapping network coverage.</p>
<h4><strong>You should have</strong></h4>
<p>&ndash; Basic to intermediate programming skills.<br />&ndash; Fundamental knowledge about Arduino and microcontrollers.</p>
<h4><strong>What to bring</strong></h4>
<p>&ndash; A computer with the Arduino IDE installed and working.<br />&ndash; A phone running a recent version of iOS or Android.</p>
<h4>What we will provide</h4>
<p>&ndash; Arduino MKR WAN 1310 Microcontroller.<br />&ndash; Aerial antenna.<br />&ndash; TMP36 Analogue Temperature Sensor.<br />&ndash; Necessary cables and wires.<br /><br /></p></div>

We design our products with the best of intentions, but wind up with features that enable abuse, and fail to seize opportunities to recognize that someone is being victimized and offer support.</p>
<p>As technology continues to become more and more embedded in our financial, personal, and domestic lives, we have the responsibility and obligation to consider those who will be harmed - psychologically and physically - by our decisions. In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll take a hard look at the many forms of domestic abuse that everyday technology enables, assess the potential risks of our own products, and identify areas where certain user behavior might indicate that they&rsquo;re perpetrating abuse or being victimized. Then we&rsquo;ll plan on how to design our products to prevent abuse and support victims.</p>

<p>In this workshop we will teach the basics of electronics and synthesizer design. To keep it old-school, we will focus on analog electronics, and to keep it manageable we will make a "non-musical" synthesizer. In other words a noisy box perfect for creating interesting sound effects and alerting your colleagues of impending meetings. We will build the different parts of the synthesizer on breadboard to get an understand of how they work, and the students will get a PCB to solder permanently. Parts will be provided.</p>
<div>The workshop will be 3 hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We will cover:</div>
<div>- Basic electronics and use of prototyping tools</div>
<div>- Basic signal processing</div>
<div>- Basic synthesizer design<br /><br /><br />Basic electronics skills are helpful, but the course is designed for beginners</div></div>

            <span class='author'>Hans Kristian Flaatten and Fredrick Myrvoll</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p>Microservices describes the promised land where each service can be implemented completely independent of any other service using any programming language and any framework? But is that even possible? How do we ensure that all services are secure and protected? How do we make sure we can know what is going on inside and between the different services? How do we ensure propper handling of errors when communicating across multiple services? How do we trace errors back to the service that caused it?</p>
<p>In a traditional microservices environment these questions must be solved individually by each service or require the use of several libraries and suddenly your "micro"-service wasn't quite as micro and you most certainly can no longer use the programming language or framework you want any more.</p>
<p>What if there was a better way of managing all these microservices and be able to preserve their individuality and without having to bundle all of the complexity into the code?</p>
<h4>The workshop will cover the following:</h4>
<p>* Setting up the Istio Service Mesh on Kubernetes</p>
<p>* Deploying our all of the individual microservices required for our webshop application</p>
<p>* Routing traffic with the Istio Ingress Controller</p>
<p>* Monitoring performance with Grafana</p>
<p>* Observing traffic flow with Kiali</p>
<p>* Distributed Tracing with OpenTracing and Jaeger</p>
<p>* Request Routing and Canary Deployments</p>
<p>* Fault Injection and Rate Limiting</p>
<p>* Service Isolation Using the Istio Mixer</p>
<p>* Securing all communication with mutial encryption (mTLS)</p>
<h4>What you will need to bring to the workshop:</h4>
<p>* A laptop</p>
<p>* Enthusiasm 😅</p>
<h4>Nice to have</h4>
<p>* Basic understanding of how microservices communicate and are deployed</p>
<p>* Basic understanding of containers and Kubernetes&nbsp;</p></div>

Or perhaps you just want to have fun and learn how easy it is to animate elements in React using a modern animations library?<br /><br />In this workshop we'll give you an introduction to one of the newest libraries for creating animations with React: Framer-Motion. You'll get hands-on experience by solving tasks we've set up for you: You'll start out with a React app resembling a card game, but where all the elements are static. It will be your job to create those animations to be able to actually play the game!</p></div>

In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll take a hard look at the many forms of domestic abuse that everyday technology enables, assess the potential risks of our own products, and identify areas where certain user behavior might indicate that they&rsquo;re perpetrating abuse or being victimized. Then we&rsquo;ll plan on how to design our products to prevent abuse and support victims.</p>
<p>Primarily for: designers, developers, project managers, and anyone else who has a hand in creating digital products.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL is an open-source data query language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data. It represent a new way to think about APIs compared to traditional methods like REST. This workshop will give you hands-on experience using GraphQL to master common API operations. We will cover basic topics like fetching data from a GraphQL server using queries and mutations, writing schemas to describe what data can be queried and getting to know the schema type system. The exercises will be implemented using NodeJS, with additional bonus tasks in React - for those who also want to make a frontend.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the workshop you will be well equipped to start implement a new, or query an existing GraphQL API</span></p></div>

<p>You have learned about and thought you understood the theory of public-private key encryption. Even so, setting up a server to demand client certificates, issuing certificates and making sure each part knows to trust each other is tricky business.</p>
<p>In this workshop we will explore the necessary code to create certificates, start an app server with https instead of http, making the client trust a self-signed server certificate and make the server request a certificate from the client.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>What we create has a huge influence on how people behave and live their lives. We are trained to solve problems and make people&rsquo;s lives better. Rarely do we consider what &lsquo;better&rsquo; actually is.<br />One can argue that ethics are a personal preference. But what happens if we actually get the conversation going and allow for all team members to voice their point of view? In this workshop we will discover how our ethics and beliefs align with projects we work on. We will explore the intended and unintended concequeses of our work on different timescales. This will allow us as teams to map out what &ldquo;better&rdquo; actually might look like and which risks to consider moving on - for any given problem.</p>
<p>The key takeaways from this practical and collaborative workshop will be</p>
<p>- how to discuss ethics in a group<br />- learn how to think about consequences long term<br />- build understanding around different perspectives when it comes to ethics<br />- train on how to talk about your own ethics<br />- create a safe space for sharing.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this workshop, we will practice using the refactoring menu in our IDE. Sometimes automated refactorings can speed up our manual editing and help us avoid errors; other times, a seemingly erratic IDE refuses to perform even the simplest operations. It is no wonder most developers shy away from any automation more complex than Rename. After this workshop, you will be able to decipher refactoring error messages, tweak your code to make automated refactorings succeed, and interleave automated transformations with manual ones to achieve the code change that you want.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop is not about improving code quality, per se. Rather, you will learn about IDE magic and curious corner cases in seemingly straightforward refactorings. We will focus on simple but powerful code transformations: Extract, Inline, and Move, and how to make them succeed in increasingly tricky application scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will collectively use IntelliJ Community edition with Java 1.8+, BUT! if you usually work with other frameworks, we strongly encourage you to disregard the provided tasks and instead explore the refactoring menu of your favorite IDE. Our main goal is to provide you with refactoring skills that you can apply in your everyday programming.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer: If you choose to work in another language, codebase or IDE, the organizer may not know the answers to your questions as they arise, but will enthusiastically lend herself to help figure them out.&nbsp;</span></em></p></div>

<p>The workshop is&nbsp;meant&nbsp;to inspire people to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;coding&nbsp;or&nbsp;teach&nbsp;others to&nbsp;code.&nbsp;The project is&nbsp;a lot of fun,&nbsp;and&nbsp;suitable to teach&nbsp;young&nbsp;or&nbsp;not-so-young&nbsp;people&nbsp;about&nbsp;programming.&nbsp;It is also a&nbsp;low&nbsp;threshold&nbsp;for people&nbsp;on IT teams who do&nbsp;not&nbsp;normally code as a part of&nbsp;their&nbsp;workday.</p>
<p>No matter&nbsp;the&nbsp;motivation,&nbsp;starting small and safe is&nbsp;a great way of learning&nbsp;about coding&nbsp;and&nbsp;trouble shooting.&nbsp;The workshop will&nbsp;provide the&nbsp;parts needed that are not mentioned in the requirements,&nbsp;to complete the&nbsp;workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Target group:</strong> Designers, testers or people a part of the team who do not usually program.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp;laptop (with USB port) for&nbsp;coding.&nbsp;One&nbsp;empty&nbsp;and&nbsp;cleaned milk&nbsp;or&nbsp;juice&nbsp;carton for the robot.</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> The&nbsp;workshop is divided into three parts and will&nbsp;take&nbsp;1,5 hours to complete.&nbsp;30 people can attend, resulting in 15 groups and 15-30&nbsp;robots.</p>
<ol>
<li>Intro to the workshop, and some cues about how to arrange your own workshop.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prepping the gear, and creating the robot. The team will be provided with all necessary tools, where the first task is to cut out the design of the robot and glue all the part together.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Programming the&nbsp;micro:bit. The coding will be done with the help of the editor&nbsp;<a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor">https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor</a>. There is an option to choose between Blocks or JavaScript. The instructions are using Blocks which is an easy&nbsp;<em>drag and drop</em>of elements.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Connect robot and micro:bit. The last step is to connect the wires to the micro:bitand robot and finally make it come to life by moving its mouth.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Further development of the robot.&nbsp;If there is time to spare, there is always the option to code more,&nbsp;change up the robot&nbsp;and&nbsp;explore&nbsp;what else is possible with the help of&nbsp;micro:bits.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy coding!&nbsp;</p>

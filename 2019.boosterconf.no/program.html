              <i class="fa fa-film"></i>
              </h4>
            <span class='author'>Marie Moe</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p>Gradually we are all becoming more and more dependent on connected technology. We will be able to live longer with an increased quality of life due to medical devices and sensors integrated into our bodies, and connected to the cloud. However, our dependence on technology grows faster than our ability to secure it, and a security failure of a medical device may cause patient harm and have fatal consequences. Medical errors are often associated with human errors, but patient safety is also threatened by security failures of medical devices. Loss of availability or integrity of patient data may indirectly cause patient harm, due to wrong diagnosis or treatment decisions based on incorrect data.</p>
<p>However, there are no good statistics on the number of deaths caused by medical device security failures. Medical devices are collecting personal data on a big scale without any transparency on how the data is collected and how the information security and privacy of patient information is ensured by the medical device manufacturers. Additionally, patients are in many cases deprived from access to their own data generated by sensors and devices implanted in their body. The medical devices appear as &ldquo;black boxes&rdquo; with little information about their data collection capabilities and implementation of security and privacy features. Dr. Marie Moe is a security researcher living with a vulnerable medical implant, a pacemaker that generates every single beat of her heart. She started a hacking project investigating the cyber security of her personal critical infrastructure, and tells her story to create awareness and to inspire others to do more research on the security of connected medical implants.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>Imagine that your org has adopted scrum, all teams are doing retros, some of action points receive management attention, sometimes even got solved. But still there is some feeling that bigger problems, which are holding your company back, cannot either be addressed or even acknowledge, just because these problems are dispersed through the whole organization an in a single team we might see only a fraction of it. So it is important to get the whole group together and get everyone heard.</p>
<p>How to form and get group's opinion? What kind of techniques you can use to organize such sessions in your organization? How the org will benefit from it?</p></div>

Java is often used for microservices. Quite a few of them use Spring Boot, which I think is overkill for simpler services. The Eclipse Foundation has worked quite a bit on the Java EE Microprofile, which is another option, where you use Java EE features and small containers. Another popular approach is the use of the many micro frameworks that have flourished, e.g. Spark, Javalin, Ktor and the up and coming Micronaut.</p>
<p>Let's build a small microservice application with Micronaut, Graal, Substrate (ahead of time compiler that's part of Graal) and Docker containers. The service will be your standard, wonderfully CURLable To Do list RESTful JSON API, and we will see just how small we can get this service, and how fast we can make it start up. This will give you a quick and dirty introduction to the spanking new Micronaut microframework, that released version 1.0 in late October. It will also be an intro to very basic use of Graal and Substrate. You are expected to know Java and very basic use of Docker (although the application(s) will be possible to run without containers).</p>
<p>After this workshop, you should hopefully feel like running back to your hotel room, start building Java microservices and throw them at the clouds in the sky. Or at least inspired to experiment further with Java microframeworks and GraalVM.<br /><br />Slides and code from the workshop can be found at:<br />https://github.com/Sardtok/micro-my-java</p></div>

It guarantees memory and thread-safety without garbage collection, offers great tooling and an amazing community &mdash; in fact, Rust has been voted the most loved programming language according to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey three years in a row. The language is experiencing rapid adaptation in multiple industries ranging from game development to backend systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this workshop, we will explore Rust and create a simple synthesizer that can be played with your computer keyboard. We will also implement rudimentary sound effects. The goal of this workshop is to learn some of the basics of Rust through a hands-on project, and no prior knowledge of Rust or audio processing is required.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please follow installation instructions found here:&nbsp;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ebkw1aSmm5Ep8ozYlzFZa4FFWg0hWgOIl8HMVVYmnkI/edit?usp=sharing<br /><br />Rust is a reliable systems programming language providing bare-metal performance in a modern wrapping. It guarantees memory and thread-safety without garbage collection, offers great tooling and an amazing community &mdash; in fact, Rust has been voted the most loved programming language according to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey three years in a row. The language is experiencing rapid adaptation in multiple industries ranging from game development to backend systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this workshop, we will explore Rust and create a simple synthesizer that can be played with your computer keyboard. We will also implement rudimentary sound effects. The goal of this workshop is to learn some of the basics of Rust through a hands-on project, and no prior knowledge of Rust or audio processing is required.</span></p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>We dreamed about using Domain driven design, but were stuck in the complex legacy monolith of a case management system.</p>
<p>While all examples and tutorials we found were for trivial domains, we had a lot of domain logic as well as years of inherited corner cases and brain overloads camouflaged as code. That obviously didn't stop us from giving DDD a try.</p>
<p>We have tried DDD in a real world legacy monolith and survived. Now we're here to tell the tale.</p>
<p>In this talk, we share our own experiences from using DDD inside a monolith, as well as lack of DDD, and you will learn to avoid the mistakes we made and how to repeat our success factors.</p>
<p>How do you use DDD in your highly complex legacy project? How do you even get started? We'll help you!</p>

<p>Traditionally, getting approvals to do research on these data has been complicated and time-consuming.</p>
<p>The new platform microdata.no reduces approval time from 9 months to 0 days, and makes these valuable data available for a much wider community of researchers.</p>
<p>Microdata.no was released in 2018 after a 5 year collaboration project between NSD and Statistics Norway (SSB). Researchers analyze data through a privacy-preserving web-IDE inspired by Jupyter notebooks and other widely used statistical tools.</p>
<p>The platform is built with ClojureScript, Clojure, Node, Python, Go and Datomic - and immutability is the cornerstone of the architecture.</p>
<p>In this short talk, we will demonstrate how NSD designed microdata.no around immutable data structures, and how this design decision enabled the development of a novel and globally unique platform for safe research on personal data.</p>
<p>We will discuss how we designed and implemented a new domain specific language (DSL) for analyses of temporal register data, how we execute the DSL with functional reactive programming, and how we use immutable data structures and databases to enforce complete statelessness and simplicity throughout the platform.</p></div>

Working in a highly technical field, it is almost a guarantee that learning a new domain is going to be extremely complicated with a steep learning curve. Not only do we need to start designing for this project immediately, but as part of our jobs we need to coordinate on the project and discuss our work with a myriad of people, such as designers, developers and project managers. A lot of the time, we will end up working with people who hold more subject knowledge than we may have, and this often results in feeling scared to speak up in group discussions, thinking we might embarrass ourselves or sound stupid by saying the wrong thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">In this talk I will focus on some of my own experiences and discuss how instead of being intimidated by subject matter experts in this situation, creatives can re-position their own idea of how to feel like a smart and qualified person in the room. By coming to the table ready to ask questions and not being afraid to share our own point of view, we can show that we are just as able to as anyone to provide great contributions, regardless of our experience in a specific technical domain. You may feel like you're not the &ldquo;smartest&rdquo;, or most knowledgeable person in the room, but you still play a vital role on the team and business. By learning how to navigate these types of uncomfortable situations, you can become a stronger contributor than ever.</span></p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have this feeling certain features will yet again start failing in upcoming release? When you catch a bug, does it seem like a deja vu? Incidents happen. Most of us think of them as materialised risks, but they also can be considered as opportunity. Opportunity to learn and improve. Would you be interested to learn how to draw conclusions from failures, propose corrective and preventive actions, and with them improve your development process and grow quality mindset in your team? This is a workshop for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all agile nowadays, thus we all strive to self improve iteration over iteration. Regular retrospectives help flush out issues with delivery process, compare current iteration with previous, identify things need addressing, areas worth investing in to increase velocity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what happens when we catch a bug? Do we sit together as a team to identify what went wrong as we would normally do seeing a drop in our velocity in current sprint? I don&rsquo;t think so. Most likely team will fix the bug and move on with feature development. Probably new regression tests will be added to prevent the bug from happening in future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regression doesn&rsquo;t prevent bugs from happening. It helps with catching recurring symptoms of deeper problems, before they reach our customer and our users. Tests alone don&rsquo;t address root causes. We&rsquo;re like doctors prescribing yet another drugs. Not spending enough time on doing patient interview to find problems with lifestyle. Missing nutrients in our team diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will learn how to spot and prevent sources of bugs. We&rsquo;ll walk you through Root Cause Analysis process on a real life incident you can relate to. Help you understand all vital parts of such analysis, and show you how you can conduct similar process next time you catch a bug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During workshop you will learn:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">techniques helping build context in which incident happened,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to build timeline and why it&rsquo;s important to have one,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to identify causal factors and how they differ from root cause,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">techniques helping figure out root cause,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are preventive and corrective actions,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how root cause analysis can not only help prevent bugs from recurring but improve your testing skills.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key takeaways:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what is root cause analysis</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what are causal factors and how they are different from root causes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- techniques helping identify root cause, propose preventive and corrective actions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- how being better in identifying root causes can help you become better tester by focusing your attention on most likely broken parts of your system</span></p></div>

Without a clear path or the support necessary to succeed, change - especially cultural change - can be daunting. Transformation can be scary and faced with resistance, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>At the heart of DevOps is the idea that teams work together to innovate faster, reducing the length of feedback loops and delivering value. Applying principles of collaborative practices, continuous improvements, incremental testing, and continuous learning can transform culture - not only within development teams, but also in some less obvious places.</p>
<p>Join me as we go through some real-world examples of applying principles that can lead to real change! We will draw analogies from the automotive safety industry - and show that these principles don't have to be used just in the context of a DevOps organization.&nbsp;<br /><br />We'll take a look at ways to get organized and find your team's purpose, identify and prioritize work, learn and define iterative feedback loops, and design experiments for continuous learning!&nbsp;</p>

It is a new syntax and a new toolchain for the OCaml language, and features easy JavaScript interop, a familiar syntax, and the ability to leverage both the JavaScript and the OCaml ecosystems. With its focus on performance and size, it is a great alternative to JavaScript for writing applications for the web.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will explore the Reason language, learning the basic syntax and tools, and looking at more advanced features, such as variants and pattern matching. We will then use this new language to build a small web application, demonstrating how we can use existing JavaScript libraries, and familiar tooling from JavaScript projects.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have this feeling certain features will yet again start failing in upcoming release? When you catch a bug, does it seem like a deja vu? Incidents happen. Most of us think of them as materialised risks, but they also can be considered as opportunity. Opportunity to learn and improve. Would you be interested to learn how to draw conclusions from failures, propose corrective and preventive actions, and with them improve your development process and grow quality mindset in your team? This is a workshop for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all agile nowadays, thus we all strive to self improve iteration over iteration. Regular retrospectives help flush out issues with delivery process, compare current iteration with previous, identify things need addressing, areas worth investing in to increase velocity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what happens when we catch a bug? Do we sit together as a team to identify what went wrong as we would normally do seeing a drop in our velocity in current sprint? I don&rsquo;t think so. Most likely team will fix the bug and move on with feature development. Probably new regression tests will be added to prevent the bug from happening in future.</span></p>

            <div class='description'><p>Reason is a language for JavaScript developers, which brings rock solid typing and type inference to the JavaScript world. It is a new syntax and a new toolchain for the OCaml language, and features easy JavaScript interop, a familiar syntax, and the ability to leverage both the JavaScript and the OCaml ecosystems. With its focus on performance and size, it is a great alternative to JavaScript for writing applications for the web.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will explore the Reason language, learning the basic syntax and tools, and looking at more advanced features, such as variants and pattern matching. We will then use this new language to build a small web application, demonstrating how we can use existing JavaScript libraries, and familiar tooling from JavaScript projects.</p></div>

            <div class='description'><p>Sheet music is perhaps the ultimate domain-specific language, but isn&rsquo;t really accessible to programmers. It hardly has any curly brackets, and they don't even match! This workshop for non-musicians demystifies musical notation by showing you how to generate it from a Scheme-based DSL, called Lilypond, which looks much more like a 'normal' programming language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this workshop you will learn the basic Lilypond syntax, starting with note pitches, durations and lyrics. You&rsquo;ll use this to generate music as PDF that you can print, and MIDI files that you can listen to. This will be based on simple and familiar examples, starting with the world&rsquo;s most recognisable tune. You&rsquo;ll also learn how Lilypond separates content from presentation, and how its automatic layout creates professional print-quality results.</p>

            <span class='author'>Dmitry Vinnik</span>
            
            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all encountered a &ldquo;Broken Window&rdquo; theory in practice. The original idea was that if someone breaks a window in a neighbourhood and this window is not repaired right away, the entire area will start getting messier at an accelerated rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same theory can be applied to Software. How many times have you looked at a legacy system with no tests, and decided not to write any automation for your new features because &lsquo;this is how it has always been&ldquo;, or &ldquo;nobody has done this before&rdquo;? By referring to the bad practices which were established before, the system continues degrading the same way a nice neighborhood can turn into a ghost town.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop aims to show how these &ldquo;Broken Window&rdquo; systems can be tackled, and how such systems can be set on the right track to high quality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker will demonstrate from his past experiences how technical and testing gaps can be covered and what every team can implement in their process to start improving existing and future products.</span></p></div>

            <div class='description'><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1999, NASA lost the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter as it went into orbital insertion. Due to a mismatch between US customary and SI units of measurements in one of the APIs, the spacecraft came to close to the planet, passed through the upper atmosphere and disintegrated. Sadly, this hasn&rsquo;t been the only instance where a mismatch between units of measurements had catastrophic consequences, but it&rsquo;s certainly one of the most spectacular and expensive ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could this happen? The bad news is: if you use primitive types to handle quantities in your code, due to that very same practice. At best, you&rsquo;ve codified the unit in the name of the variable or the database field, e.g. calling it lengthInMetres. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re only relying on convention, just like Lockheed Martin and NASA did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join this workshop to learn how JSR 385 can help you avoid $125 million mistakes, and discover the immeasurable world of dimensions, units and quantities.</span></p>

<h1>Detailed description:</h1>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A learning workshop that is designed to be heavily hands-on and suitable for anyone and everyone who wants to get answers to problems and not just coaches.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When trying to discover solutions to a client&rsquo;s needs it&rsquo;s very easy to go into consultancy or teaching mode. Often these are not necessary or even desirable as the client is likely to have far more context-based knowledge and so it&rsquo;s important to use this intrinsic knowledge as much as possible. Clean Language (CL) is very good at preventing these personal opinions and &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; suggestions and this session aims to provide enough real practice so that participants overcome any initial apprehension, leaving confident and able to use in a work environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This workshop uses Mike Burrows 15-Minute FOTO exercise as a basis, enabling participants to take turns and practice in small groups and in a safe non-live environment. It is a very practical session with the expectation that participants will discover their own solutions and real options that they can then explore further and put into practice after they leave.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is organised around the participants learning for themselves and as such designed to be slide presentation free, instead each person will leave with their own simple reminder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The primary focus will be to allow participants adequate time to be comfortable using Clean Language and depending on the speed of the participants, we would then like to expand further on their outcomes previously generated. Showing a simple method for prioritisation and discovering how to use these options as a basis for an experiment, taking the hypothetical idea into a real-world solution.</p></div>

Continue reading.<br /><br />Is your team building application program interfaces (RESTful APIs) &nbsp;faster than you can say &ldquo;Ready for deployment&rdquo; ? <br />Are you being asked to test them, or are you simply curious about how you can test APIs? <br /><br />More and more APIs are made available, makes it possible for applications to share and correlate data in with ease. Services provided by the likes of Google, Yelp, Instagram and more gives us the opportunity to create user experiences limited only by the imagination. And coming soon is a real game-changer: PSD2, the EU directive driving banks to make their customer's financial data available to them through third-party applications.</p>
<p>Whether you are building an API or consuming it, more knowledge around API testing will be needed. &nbsp;<br /><br />Of the many different tools available out there that can be used to test APIs, we wish to focus on Postman. This lets you test APIs in a simple way and it is used by many developers. So why not learn what it is and how to use Postman? <br /><br />In this workshop we will start from scratch going through what is HTTP response codes, JSON, API, etc. before we start playing around with Postman.<br /><br /></p></div>

            <div class='description'><p style="font-weight: 400;">Software security is about creating software that keeps performing as intended even when exposed to an active attacker. However, it is impossible to prevent all security flaws and vulnerabilities, since you will always have limited resources, in terms of time, money, and/or expertise. It is thus most important to prevent, detect and remove flaws and vulnerabilities with high risk, i.e., those that can easily be exploited by attackers, and that may impact important assets. Protection Poker is a tool for risk estimation to be used as part of the sprint planning meeting, in order to identify the features in the current sprint that represent the highest security risk, and that thus may need additional attention to software security and/or functional security requirements. An important side-effect of playing Protection Poker is a general raising of security awareness within the development team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Protection Poker is meant to played by the whole team, and for each feature at least two rounds will be played: Once to determine the value of each asset the feature/requirement "touches", and once to determine the exposure of the feature. We define exposure as the extent to which the feature (when implemented) increases the attack surface of the system, what type of assets are made available through the feature, and to what extent it requires special competence to exploit the feature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This talk will explain the basics of Protection Poker, and explain how it can be played. Participants will then get a chance to play Protection Poker themselves, on an artificial case. Protection poker cards will be provided for all participants.</p>
